# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various **Data Structures and Algorithms** in Java, compiled during my learning journey. Each implementation is accompanied by a [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg) file that provides theoretical explanations and insights to aid understanding.

## Structure

The repository is organized into distinct categories to help navigate different topics easily:

```
src/
├── Arrays
│   └── DynamicArrays
├── Complexity
├── Graphs
│   ├── GraphSearchAlgorithms
│   └── Trees
│       └── BinaryTrees
│           └── Heaps
├── HashTables
├── LinkedLists
├── Matrices
├── Queues
├── Recursion
├── SearchAlgorithms
├── SortingAlgorithms
├── Stacks
└── Strings
```

Each folder contains Java implementations for specific data structures or algorithms. Alongside the code, you will find corresponding `.norg` files that delve into the theoretical background and explanations.

## Getting Started

To run the Java implementations, you can clone the repository and navigate to the desired folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VanshajSaxena/DSA.git
cd DSA/src/<desired-directory>
```

Compile and run the Java files using the following commands:

```bash
javac <filename>.java
java <filename>
```

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request or raise an issue if you have any suggestions for improvement or additional implementations.
