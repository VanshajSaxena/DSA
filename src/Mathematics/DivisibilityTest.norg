These are simple divisibility rules for numbers 1-9. They are useful for quickly determining if a number is divisible by a certain number.

~ *1*: All numbers are divisible by 1.
~ *2*: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
~ *3*: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
~ *4*: A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number divisible by 4.
~ *5*: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.
~ *6*: A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.
~ *7*: A number is divisible by 7 if doubling the last digit and subtracting it from the rest of the number yields a multiple of 7.
~ *8*: A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits form a number divisible by 8.
~ *9*: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
