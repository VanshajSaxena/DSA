* Depth First Search

  *DFS:* A search algorithm for traversing a tree or graph data structure. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

  ~ Pick a route
  ~ Keep going until you reach a dead end, or a previously visited node.
  ~ Backtrack to last node that has unvisited adjacent neighbors.
