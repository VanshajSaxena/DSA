* Breadth First Search

  *BFS:* A search algorithm for traversing a tree or graph data structure. It starts at the tree root and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

  ~ This is done one "level" at a time, rather than one "branch" at a time.
