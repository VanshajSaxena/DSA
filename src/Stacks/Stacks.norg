* *What is a Stack Data Structure?*

  - A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It behaves like a stack of plates, where the last plate added is the first one to be removed.

** *Key Operations on Stack Data Structure*
   - *Push:* Adds an element to the top of the stack.
   - *Pop:* Removes the top element from the stack.
   - *Peek:* Returns the top element without removing it.
   - *IsEmpty:* Checks if the stack is empty.
   - *IsFull:* Checks if the stack is full.
