* Dynamic Programming

  Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique and a field of mathematics.

  For Dynamic Programming to be applicable to a problem, the problem must have
  two properties:

  ~ [Optimal Substructure]{# Optimal Substructure}
  ~ [Overlapping Subproblems]{# Overlapping Subproblems}

** Optimal Substructure

** Overlapping Subproblems
