* Dynamic Programming

  Dynamic Programming is a *mathematical optimization technique* and an
  *algorithmic paradigm*.

  For Dynamic Programming to be applicable to a problem, the problem must have
  two properties:

  ~ [Optimal Substructure]{# Optimal Substructure}
  ~ [Overlapping Subproblems]{# Overlapping Subproblems}

** Optimal Substructure

** Overlapping Subproblems
